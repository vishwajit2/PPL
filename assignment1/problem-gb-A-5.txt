A-5 Static Single Assignment
-----------------------------

        Now, we are  going to take a  look at the Static  Single Assignment form
        that GCC uses later during optimization.  In SSA form, each variable may
        be assigned at most once. Also,  exactly one assignment of each variable
        dominates every use of the variable.

        In order  to implement SSA, local  variables are suffixed with  a unique
        number which represents the assignment.  For example, two assignments to
        the variable `a' may look like `a_0' and `a_1'.

        Compile the following program (file A-5.c) and observe the dumps.

        Source file : A-5.c
        Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-cfg -fdump-tree-ssa A-5.c
        View result : vi -O A-5.c.*.cfg A-5.c.*.ssa
        Clear dumps : rm -f A-5.c.* A-5.o

Program
-------

        int main()
        {
            int a, b, c, d;

            d = 10;
            if (c > d) {
                a = 3;
                b = 2;
            } else {
                a = 2;
                b = 3;
            }

            c = a + b;
        }



Questions
---------

        1   Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a
            suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? Why do some variables
            have a suffix `(D)'?

        2   Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments
            to variable `a'  and `b' merge. You will notice  that PHI statements
            have  been  introduced.  Can  you   guess  the  syntax  of  the  PHI
            statements?

        3   Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two
            versions of a variable?

Answer :
        1.  In SSA form, program variables are assigned 
            in exactly one location in the program. Multiple assignments to the same 
            variable create new versions of that variable. Naturally, actual programs 
            are rarely in SSA form initially because variables tend to be assigned multiple 
            times. The compiler modifies the program representation so that every time a variable 
            is assigned in the code, a new version of the variable is created. Different versions 
            of the same variable are distinguished by subscripting the variable name with its version 
            number. Variables used in the right-hand side of expressions are renamed so that their 
            version number matches that of the most recent assignment.
                (D) means it's missing a definition? (e.g. c is undefined in its use in the first 
            conditional)

        2.  Syntax of phi statements is  PHI < prec_1, prec_2, ... prec_n > where each
            prec_i has form name(bb) where name is name of the variable and bb is index of
            the basic block in which it was declared. There will be a prec_i for each
            preceding BB from which control flow can enter the current BB.

        3. In the Switch case statements and nested if-else blocks etc .
